# Benchmarks

Every number in iClean's documentation comes from this file. Anything not here is
"not yet measured".

- **Machine:** Apple M3 Pro (Mac15,6), 18 GB RAM, internal SSD
- **OS:** macOS 27.0.1
- **Date:** 2026-09-30
- **Build:** release, universal binary
- **How:** `iclean bench` (source: [`Sources/ICSystem/Bench.swift`](../Sources/ICSystem/Bench.swift)).
  It only signals `ic-hog` processes that it starts itself. Pressure is induced by
  incompressible allocations, stops as soon as the frozen victim is compressed, and is
  capped at 40% of RAM with aborts on critical pressure or +768 MB swap.
- **Runs:** the latency rows are 30 freeze/thaw cycles each (p50/p95/p99 over all
  cycles, not the best one). The pressure rows come from **one** pressure run. They
  show the effect exists but carry no spread; treat them as single observations.

## Results

| thaw, no pressure, 1024 MB: SIGCONT to all pages touched (ms) | 0.77 | 0.92 | 6.01 | 6.01 | 30 |
| daemon tick: wall time (ms) | 27.88 | 28.92 | 28.92 | 28.92 | 10 |

| S4 guard inspection of every regular app (ms) | 1.02 | 3.23 | 3.23 | 3.23 | 10 |

| Single observation (one pressure run) | Measured |
|---|---|
| victim resident before freeze (MB) | 518.77 |
| frozen victim resident after induced pressure (MB) | 6.22 |
| running twin (same allocation, touches its memory every 2 s) resident after (MB) | 517.66 |
| memory induced, including victims (MB) | 5888 |
| swap growth during the run (MB) | 0 |
| thaw under pressure, 512 MB victim: SIGCONT to all pages touched (ms) | 79.79 |
| S3 cold thaw: user arrival to working set back (ms) | 35.94 |
| S3 pre-thawed 2 s early: user arrival to working set back (ms) | 34.96 |
| S7 simultaneous thaw of 4 × 128 MB: first app usable (ms) | 37.72 |
| S7 simultaneous thaw of 4 × 128 MB: all usable (ms) | 40.10 |
| S7 staged thaw of 4 × 128 MB: first app usable (ms) | 16.66 |
| S7 staged thaw of 4 × 128 MB: all usable (ms) | 71.86 |

## Daemon overhead (installed, idle)

Measured on the installed release daemon (LaunchAgent, Observe mode, normal pressure)
with `ps -o time=,rss=` before and after an idle window:

| Build | Window | CPU time used | Average CPU | Resident memory |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| first version (15 s idle tick, per-PID name scan) | 90 s | 0.58 s | 0.64% | 39 MB |
| current (30 s idle tick, one `KERN_PROC_ALL` call) | 120 s | 0.42 s | 0.35% | 40 MB |

The first version missed the < 0.5% target, which led to the change. The in-process
benchmark estimate (tick CPU ÷ 15 s = 0.47%) is also listed above for the old interval.

## What the numbers say, and do not say

- **Freezing is what lets macOS reclaim a busy background app.** Under pressure the
  frozen victim went from 519 MB to 6 MB resident, while an identical process that
  kept touching its memory kept all of it. An app that is idle and never wakes up is
  compressed by macOS anyway, frozen or not. iClean's benefit is limited to apps that
  keep waking up in the background.
- **The thaw signal itself is free** (well under 1 ms). What a user can feel is macOS
  faulting reclaimed memory back in: 80 ms for 512 MB here under pressure.
- **Pre-thaw (S3) showed no benefit** (35.9 ms vs 35.0 ms). Resuming early does not
  bring pages back until the app touches them. Pre-thaw ships **off**, and habit
  statistics are only used to estimate "will the user come back soon" for S2.
- **Staged thaw (S7) is a trade-off.** The first app was usable 2.3× sooner, but the
  last one 1.8× later. iClean stages thaws because people use one app at a time, and
  the app being activated always goes first. The last-app cost is documented here.
- **Not yet measured:** memory reclaimed from real apps (browsers, Electron) as opposed
  to `ic-hog`; thaw latency of real GUI apps (needs Accessibility, see
  [FEASIBILITY §6](FEASIBILITY.md)); energy savings; behaviour on Intel Macs, 8 GB
  Macs and spinning disks; forecast accuracy on real traces (only the synthetic golden
  traces exist, see [SIGNATURE_FEATURES.md](SIGNATURE_FEATURES.md)).

## Reproduce

```sh
scripts/build-release.sh
dist/iclean-1.0.0/iclean bench            # markdown table
dist/iclean-1.0.0/iclean bench --json     # machine-readable
dist/iclean-1.0.0/iclean bench --quick    # smaller, lower pressure cap (25%)
```

The pressure scenario uses real memory. Close unsaved work first.
